# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like modding BTD6 and other games (but primarily BTD6)

I have a series on YouTube called How to Mod BTD6 so check it out if you like!

### My Current BTD6 Mods are (in list of creation & all of the public ones):

[Darks Towers](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/DarksTowers) This is my first mod

[Customizable Tower](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/CustomizableTower) This was my first popular mod. One of the more technical mods.

[Cash Buttons](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/CashButtons) This one is currently broken and I'm going to make a new one.

[Missile Monkey](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/MissileMonkey) This is the first mod I made for someone! 

[??? Monkey](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/Cool-Tower) This mod was also made with Mattcy1

[Custom Bloon](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/CustomBloon) This is my second and probably last customizable mod. Not as popular as Customizable Tower.

[Bloon Progression](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/BloonProgression) This was my first challenge mod. 

[Example Mod](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/ExampleMod) This is for my How to Mod BTD6 series on YouTube.

[Twelve Tier Banana Farm](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/TwelveTierBananaFarm) This is my first finished mod using Paths++ (I guess you could say Darks Towers Extra Content is the first one, but that one never came out)

[Christmas Mod](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/ChristmasMod) It's a mod for christmas time. I planned to have a round set... but that never happened

[Many Big (and small!) Things](https://github.com/DarkTerraYT/ManyBigThings) Makes towers bigger or smaller. Option to change radius or range of said tower
